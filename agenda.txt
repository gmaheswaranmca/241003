1. git hub
    1.1 user subscription 
    1.2 create remote repo in git hub 
    1.3 upload the file in the git hub repo 

2. git
    2.1 downloading the git software 
        install it locally 
    2.2 open terminal in the working folder 
        to check the git is installed or not 
        $ git --version 
        OR 
        $ git -v 
    2.3 to download / clone the remote repo to the local computer 
        git clone url_of_the_repo 
        example:
            git clone https://github.com/gmaheswaranmca/241003.git
        
        This will help us to download the public repo for read only purpose 
    2.4 to clone the remote repo for update purpose 
        ie to update locally 
        and to update in the remote repo also 

        we have to create the "token" ie "personal access token" or "PAT" 

        Steps to create the token 
            User menu 
                -> Settings 
                    -> at Left Side Bar menu, Developer Settings 
                        -> Personal Access Token 
                            token (classic)
                            -> Right Side "Create personal access token (Classic)"
                    Notes for the token 
                    expiration like 30 days or 90 days 
                    scopes 
                        [x] repo 
                        [x] admin:hook 
                        [x] delete repo 
                    Create token 
                Copy the token preseve in the computer or in the mail 
        Once we created the token 
            We will clone the remote with along with token 
                git clone https://<token>@github.com/gmaheswaranmca/241003.git

                Replace <token> with actual "token" from git hub.
            
        Run the command in the working folder 
        We have the repo to see the contents of the repo 
            to update the local repo to remote repo as well 

        Now we can open the local repo in the vscode 
            $ code . 
            This command we have to run in the repo folder in the terminal 

3. How to work with the repo in the local computer 
    A. via visual studio code 
        Source control icon in the left panel (menu)

        We can add the files under the "changes" section using "+" command 

        This "+" is the "git add" command 
            We are staging the changed files 
            We can see here the "staged changes" section.


        Then we are raising the command "Commit" with message.

        The "+" command and "commit" together will upate the changed 
        files into local repo. 
                    OR 
        in the command prompt:
           $ git add .
           $ git commit -m "message"
        to check the command are working or not:
            $ git status 

    B. "Sync" command will take the local changes to "remote repo" 
        The sync is nothing but "git pull + git push"

        OR 

        in the command prompt:
           $ git pull origin main 
           $ git push origin main
